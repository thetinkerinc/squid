Squid is a simple finance tracking app that I made to try out a new tech stack that I'm working on. If you happen to come across this, feel free to give it a try!

Besides playing around with some new technologies, I wanted a few things out of a finance tracker:

- Ability to track bank account and cash separately
- Easy support for multiple currencies
- Quick visual breakdown of expenses
- Categories and descriptions to organize entries
- Collaboration with other people
